# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

> I have designed an interactive device that serves as a Smart Productivity tool that uses light to denote the progress of one's workload. It would change hue based on how much work is left on the integrated to-do list (e.g., red -> yellow -> green), and it would change in the intensity of its color based on the time spent on those tasks. And rather than the user having to manually update their tasks on the todo list, they can use their voice and Amazon Alexa to update it automatically. I envision this product to be a home-office staple. This will generally be used when somebody starts their workday or study session. The goal here is to help users understand their workload and also help them make educated decisions on when to take breaks. In terms of the players, the relevant personnel are the individuals who link their device to their calendar as well as the folks who may interact with those individuals while they are working. 


Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning. **It does not need to be perfect**, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Calvin Tirrell: 
> Great visuals on the storyboards and it’s clear what the device will be used for when you act it out. Simple, functional and effective! The only thing I find a bit odd is the flow of the frames and where they’re located but it might just be me. It’s not a big deal since you labeled the frames accordingly but just a small thing

Brian Mulyadi:
> Clear storyboard! Maybe something that is missing is the controller, meaning what John does to set these up - something along via an app or via a physical device. But other than that, all good! I particularly like the page 3 functionality :)

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

> I think that the functionality seemed quite simple and straight forward, but in reality, there's many moving parts and thus many points of failure. For example, I found that connecting my phone to Alexa and the Razer hardware would oftentimes go offline. Additionally, Alexa's Speech-to-text functionality would sometimes not work, and I'd have to try to pronounce things a bit more clearly. Finally, WiFi connectivity presents some issues, especially with respect to the proposed functionality of keeping track of time (e.g., does it assume that the session is over or does it keep track on local?)

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

> Not particularly, we had come up with many ideas prior to the acting and thus there was not much more ideation at this time.


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

> The Tinkerbelle is really cool and a great foundation for our tasks. What would be helpful to include in the future would be additional functionalities such as being able to create sequences of color, blinking of colors, etc. This way, student's would be able to make more interesting product demos.


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

[![WizardDeviceVideo](https://github.com/michaelchoie/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/86a3c327eebbf25ee950b2729b0d0babd8f87f40/Lab%201/Lab%201%20-%20Storyboards/WizardDeviceScreenCap.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15V_cmwZjicd1kwCpcrKrhP4gITB2rjh8/view?usp=sharing)


Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*
![sketch1](https://github.com/michaelchoie/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/bd393b5aa3447af60d4472ceb01a8a2ba53c18ac/Lab%201/Lab%201%20-%20Storyboards/Costumes/Page1.png)

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
> The concern I have is that the LED light medium must be connected to wifi so that it can update appropriately. Therefore, albeit I wish to make the design small and sleek, it may be limited by the hardware necessary to receive wifi signals. 

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 
> I would like to thank the examples of previous labs, especially Panda Xu 2 years ago: https://github.com/30PandaX/Interactive-Lab-Hub/tree/Spring2021/Lab%201. Additionally, I would like to thank Razer, as I have utilized their hardware and integrations with Alexa specifically in order to conduct this exercise. 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

Hongjiao Zhang , Aug 30 at 9:20am
> Storyboards are super clear and detailed in every function and scenario. Michael's idea is brilliant and can be really helpful for people to track their productivity and time management. Using Alexa to control the tool is very smart and convenient. This is really functional and can be used in many circumstances.

Rahul Jain , Aug 30 at 11:33am
> Hi - I think this is a great idea. I thought it was clear how the user could look at the light coming from their keyboard/mouse to understand how many tasks are remaining. One idea I have for you is to maybe incorporate how much time each of those tasks could take, sort of like a weighting. Great job!

Aashika Perunkolam , Sep 1 at 9:25am
> You could add a sound alert for time-critical tasks on the to do list and have a color to specifically tell the user to prioritize that particular task.


## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
